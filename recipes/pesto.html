    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/author/chef-john/">Chef John Mitzewich</a> once again shows us why there are
        professional chefs, and the rest of the us. This pesto is a
        delight for the senses, and the extradorinary tastes (yes, plural, it is a party) come paired with a sense of
        satisfaction having made this
        beautiful dish without any electricity except whatever exists in your own person.</p>
    <p>If you're throwing a dinner party, guests can take turns at the pestle and mortar which invites everyone to feel
        a sense of accomplishment from having played a part in bringing this culinary delight to fruition.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 large bunch fresh basil (about 4 to 5 ounces)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons pines nuts</li>
        <li>2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mild extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Crush garlic and pinch of kosher salt in a mortar with the pestle until garlic is mashed and paste-like (1
            or 2 minutes).</li>
        <li>Add basil in 3 or 4 additions, crushing and pounding down the leaves until they form a fairly fine paste
            (about 8 minutes). </li>
        <li>Add and pound in pine nuts.</li>
        <li>Transfer a handful of grated cheese to mortar and pound into the sauce. Add another handful of cheese and
            incorporate into the mixture. Continue adding cheese a handful at a time until completely incorporated
            (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Drizzle in olive oil 1 tablespoon at a time, pounding it into the sauce. When all the olive oil has been
            added and emulsified into the mixture, transfer pesto to a bowl and drizzle the surface with olive oil.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use a microplane to finely grate the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Two ounces should yield about 1 1/2 cups of
            unpacked grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Of course, you can play around with the ratios of the five ingredients and easily adjust this to your taste,
            but no matter how they're combined, taking the time to crush them by hand is well worth the effort.</li>
    </ul>
